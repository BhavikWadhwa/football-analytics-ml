# Canada West Soccer Match Predictor

A Python + Streamlit web app that scrapes real match data from the [Canada West Soccer League](https://canadawest.org/sports/msoc/2025-26/schedule), trains a predictive model, and lets users predict match outcomes between any two university teams.

---

## Features
- **Automated Web Scraper**: Collects the latest match results directly from the Canada West website.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses logistic regression to predict match results (`home_win`, `away_win`, `draw`).
- **Interactive Streamlit App**: Choose any two teams and view predicted outcomes with confidence percentages.
- **Fully Reproducible**: All data, code, and model files are included.
